# Math Scripts

## Introduction

Random scripts I make out of some courses.
They're usable, but sometimes really specific...

## Scripts

- [a link](https://github.com/mxstoto6/math-scripts/blob/main/Scrpits/complex-a-to-t.py)
    This script converts a complex number's algebraic expression to its trigonometric form.
    You'll have manually define the `reNumber` and `imNumber` so that you can use `m.sqrt()` and other functions.
