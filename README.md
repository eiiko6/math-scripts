# Math Scripts

## Introduction

I like to put into python what I learn in math lessons.
So here are some small scripts i made. They're usable, but sometimes really specific...

## Scripts

- #### [complex-a-to-t.py](https://github.com/mxstoto6/math-scripts/blob/main/Scrpits/complex-a-to-t.py)   
    This script converts a complex number's algebraic expression to its trigonometric form.   
    You'll have to manually define the `reNumber` and `imNumber` so that you can use `m.sqrt()` and other functions.
